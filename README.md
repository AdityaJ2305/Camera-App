# Simple Camera Application for iOS

This iOS Camera application allows users to capture images using the device’s camera, display them in an `UIImageView`, and save them to the iPhone's Photos gallery. The app also includes error handling in case the device does not have a camera or the user denies gallery access.


## Features

- **Capture Image**: Capture an image using the device’s camera.
- **Display Image**: The captured image is displayed in a `UIImageView`.
- **Save to Photos**: The captured image can be saved to the device’s Photos library.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback if the camera is unavailable or if there are issues accessing the photo gallery.



## Requirements

- **Xcode**: Version 12.0 or later.
- **Device**: A physical iOS device is required as the camera functionality is not available in simulators.
